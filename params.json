{"name":"Idlelands","tagline":"An idling game set in the realm of IRC. It has a modular backend that can be added to any existing frontend (if the frontend uses node).","body":"### Idle Lands\r\nIdle Lands is an idling game that takes a couple twists on the original IdleRPG formula. The primary difference is the amount and breadth of events and items that we support and the comical situations that can arise. The second difference is the combat system. \r\n\r\n### Want to join?\r\n\r\nWe're in a couple of irc networks, currently we're in irc.snoonet.org, irc.esper.net, irc.freenode.net -- the channel is #idlebot. You can find us in irc.esper.net##idlebot if you want to chat with the devs.\r\n\r\n### Differences\r\n\r\nHere are a few sample events:\r\n```\r\n<@IdleMaster> Grooglar stumbled across a wishing well, threw spined indigo potato sack in, and it got enchanted! [dex = 10 | +0 -> +1]\r\n\r\n<@IdleMaster> Judge was given a airbrushed free barette by a shady magician. [21 -> 67 | +46]\r\n\r\n<@IdleMaster> Pakalu Papito practices in cake decoration, and succeeds in proportions greater than cheesecake! Pakalu Papito won a cake-decorating contest with his cake, earning him 100xp as a reward! [100xp, ~0.344%]\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere is an example of combat:\r\n```\r\n<@IdleMaster> A battle is raging...\r\n<@IdleMaster> A new combat round has started.
